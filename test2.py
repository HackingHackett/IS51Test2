
In the main function I open the Final.txt file and then I get all the values on each line
which are the grades and put them into a list. They are all strings so i iterate through 
the list convert the individual grades in strings to integers and put them into another filke.
Then I add up the numbers in integers list to get the overall sum and divide by the length of the list
to get the average grade.

In the calculate_percent_above_average I take the average and the list of integers and I do comparisons 
to find out the total number of people with above average grades and divide that as a percentage of the total 
number of grades and round to find the number of people with above average grades.
